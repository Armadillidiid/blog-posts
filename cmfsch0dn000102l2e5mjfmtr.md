> NOTE: This is a cross-post I made on [r/awscertifications](https://www.reddit.com/r/AWSCertifications/).

My result just came 12 hours after the exam and I passed! I'm really happy and thought I should share my experience on how I prepared.

For studying, I combined [Stephane Maarek's](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate-dva-c01/) and [Adrian Cantrill's course](https://learn.cantrill.io/p/aws-certified-developer-associate). At first glance, it seems overkill to combine the two, but they complement each other. From my experience, Cantril’s is more for deep learning, while Stephane’s is more exam-focused.

I started with Cantrill's course because I really wanted to learn how to take advantage of the services in my day-to-day. The downside is it's very long (68 hours duration). I switched to 2x speed after some point and advise you do the same.

Meanwhile, I used Stephane's course as a means to revise what I had learned while I was taking practice exams. His course (total 34 hours) is more of a bullet-point style with important facts and details you should know for the exam. It was perfect for revising.

After finishing Cantrill's course, I decide it was time to start doing practice questions. I used mostly [Stephane Maarek's practice questions](https://www.udemy.com/share/101YDy3@d6Q7O_cT1lIFbrUDuqmdRSdvLSjZrLY1O-c8uC366K7EdNZLKJ0djyy4mzc5gBeG/) I bought on Udemy, and just out of sheer curiosity, I also bought [Tutorials Dojo's practice questions](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-amazon-practice-exams-saa-c03/) too because of the community. Though, I only took just one of the exams (SAA-CO3).

My first practice exam was brutal as you would expect, scoring exactly the pass mark. After each exam, I would go over and review every incorrect and flagged question.

With my exam scheduled, I took all 6 practice exam over the course of 2 weeks in Udemy's "exam mode". I did exam mode for all first attempts specifically as I wanted to simulate the exam and see how much time I would have left. I advise you do the same (at least once), but def ditch it for re-attempts.

| Attempts | Exam 1 | Exam 2 | Exam 3 | Exam 4 | Exam 5 | Exam 6 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1st (Exam mode) | 72% | 75% | 73% | 73% | 86% | 76% |
| 2nd (Practice mode) | 89% | 92% | 84% | \- | \- | \- |

Just to touch a little more on my exp. using TD vs Stepane practice questions. TL;DR, TD's question is more similar to the real exam question and thoughtfully crafted. It was doubtfully noticeable within the first 15 questions.

Some of Stephane's question felt poorly worded and would lead to you picking the wrong answer. Nevertheless, they were mostly okay, but get TD if you can.

For the actual exam, it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be, ngl. I got asked your typical questions on Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway, Cognito, etc. Most of the question were mostly on serverless stuff. Though, I got only like 1 on Beanstalk and Step functions (your mileage might vary).

I finished all 65 questions under 2 hours with 20 minutes to spare. By the end, I had flagged 7 questions and used the remaining time to review them.

Honestly, If you studied well for the exam and scaled through practice exams, you'll have no problem passing. I know most people say after the exam they wasn't sure if they had passed or failed, but I felt kinda confident. Of course, there's always some level of uncertainty but I would have been more shocked if I had failed than passed. You get the point.

For timeframe, all this took about 3 months as I was juggling studying with my day job.

Btw, I used this [Notion notes](https://arkalim.notion.site/Notes-143374c83daa4d4991b07400056a2aa9) I had bookmarked from the community to revise every service I had studied hours before the exam. It's a godsend. Like really.

Also, in as much as Stephane and Cantrill's course were my primary course material, I read a ton of the [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/). I feel this has to be mentioned as some parts of the courses are outdated and you wouldn't know if you don't fact check.

And that's about it. I hope whoever is preparing find this post useful!
