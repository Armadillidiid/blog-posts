title: A Comprehensive Guide to JavaScript Generators
---

Generators are a powerful concept in programming that allows you to easily define iterators. They're an
abstraction that allows you to write code that can be paused and resumed, allowing you to control the
execution flow.

In this article, we’ll go over what are generators functions, how to create them, and
their usefulness in processing streams of data and long-running asynchronous operations.

## Understanding JavaScript Generators?

A generator function is a special type of function that returns a `Generator` object and conforms to the [iterable protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#the_iterable_protocol) and the [iterator protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#the_iterator_protocol). They were first introduced in [ES5](https://262.ecma-international.org/6.0) and have since become a fundamental part of the language.

They are defined using the function keyword suffixed with an asterisks like so `function*`. Here's an example:

```typescript
function* generatorFunction() {
  return "Hello World";
}
```

Sometimes, you might find the asterisks prefixed to the function name like so `*function`. This is syntax is less common but is still valid.

In a normal function, when you call it, it runs to completion and returns a value. However, with generator functions, when you call them, they return a `Generator` object. This object is an [iterator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#The_iterator_protocol) that we can then use to iterate over the values.

An iterator is an object that has a `next()` method available, which is used for looping through a sequence of values. The `next()` method returns an object with `value`` and`done``properties.`value`represent the returned value, and`done` indicates whether the iterator has run through all its values or not.

To begin, let's initialize our generator function and retrieve its value:

```typescript
const generator = generatorFunction();
```

If you try to log the value of the generator object, you'll notice that it's not a string `Hello World` as expected. Instead, it's a `Generator` object with a `suspended` state. The `suspended` state means that the generator function has not yet started executing.

To get the value of the generator function, we need to call the `next()` method on the generator object:

```typescript
const result = generator.next();
```

This will give us the following output:

```typescript
{ value: 'Hello World', done: true }
```

It returned our `Hello World` string as the `value` of the object key and the state `done` equal `true` because there is no more code to execute. As a result, the status of the generator function changes from `suspended` to `closed`.

So far we've only seen how to return a single value from a generator function. But what if we want to return multiple values? This is where the `yield` operator comes in.

## The yield Operator

Take for exmaple the following function:

```typescript
function* generatorFunction() {
  yield "first value";
  yield "second value";
  yield "third value";
  yield "last value";
}
```

When we invoke the `next()` method on the generator object, it will pause each time it meets `yield`. The `done` property will be `false` after each yield as it's still in progress. Once there are no further yields in the function, or it reaches a `return` statement, `done` property will change to `true`, indicating that the generator has completed its execution.

If we call the `next()` method four times, we'll get the following output:

```typescript
const generator = generatorFunction();
generator.next(); // { value: 'first value', done: false }
generator.next(); // { value: 'second value', done: false }
generator.next(); // { value: 'third value', done: false }
generator.next(); // { value: 'last value', done: true }
```

But not only can we use the `yield` keyword to return values, but we can also use it to receive values from the caller.

## Passing Values to Generators

Yield in generator functions are two-way streets. They can both return values and receive values from the caller. To pass a value to a generator function, we can call the `next()` method with an argument.

```typescript
function* generatorFunction() {
  console.log(yield);
  console.log(yield);
}

const generator = generatorFunction();

generator.next();
generator.next("first input");
generator.next("second input");
```

This would log the following sequentially:

```typescript
first input
second input
```

> It's also important to note that the first call to the `next()` method will always be `undefined`. This is because the first `next()` call does not have a corresponding `suspended` yield operation, so there's no way to get the argument passed to it.

## Processing Long Async Operations and Streams

With the arrival of [ECMAScript 2017](https://262.ecma-international.org/8.0/index.html), we got the `async` versions of generator functions. They're referred to as [async generators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/AsyncGenerator) as they always yield a promise object.

This gives us a plethora of possibilities to work with as our code is no longer bound by being synchronous. We can now work with asynchronous operations like fetching data from an API, reading files, or any other operation that requires resolving a promise.

Here's a simple example of an async generator function:

```typescript
async function* asyncGenerator() {
  yield await Promise.resolve("1");
  yield await Promise.resolve("2");
  yield await Promise.resolve("3");
}

const generator = asyncGenerator();
await generator.next(); // { value: '1', done: false }
await generator.next(); // { value: '2', done: false }
await generator.next(); // { value: '3', done: true }
```

The only difference here is that we're awaiting the `next()` method call before we can gain the value of the iterator result.

We can go a step further to show how we can use async generators to view paginated datasets from a remote API. This is a perfect use case for async generators as we can encapsulate our sequential iteration logic in a single function.

For this example, we'll use the free [DummyJSON API](https://dummyjson.com) to fetch a list of paginated products.

To get data from this API, we can make a GET request to the following endpoint. We'll pass `limit` and `skip` params to limit and skip the results for pagination:

```
https://dummyjson.com/products?limit=10&skip=0
```

The request will respond with a JSON object that looks similar to this:

```json
{
  "products": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Annibale Colombo Bed",
      "price": 1899.99
    },
    {...},
    // 10 items
  ],
  "total": 194,
  "skip": 0,
  "limit": 10
}
```

To get the next page of products, we can increment the `skip` parameter by the `limit` value. We can continue this process until we reach the total number of products.

With that in mind, this is how we can implement a custom generator function to fetch all the products from the API:

```typescript
async function* fetchProducts(skip = 0, limit = 10) {
  let total = 0;

  do {
    const response = await fetch(
      `https://dummyjson.com/products?limit=${limit}&skip=${skip}`,
    );
    const { products, total: totalProducts } = await response.json();

    total = totalProducts;
    skip += limit;
    yield products;
  } while (skip < total);
}
```

Now we can iterate over it to get all the products using `for await...of` loop:

```typescript
for await (const products of fetchProducts()) {
  for (const product of products) {
    console.log(product.title);
  }
}
```

It will log the products until there is no more data to fetch.

```txt
Essence Mascara Lash Princess
Eyeshadow Palette with Mirror
Powder Canister
Red Lipstick
Red Nail Polish
... // 15 more items
```

## Generators as State Machines

Generators can function as simple state machines due to their ability to remember their previous state. However, it's important to note that while they can be used for this purpose, they aren't practical choice compared to the built-in solutions provided by your perhaps JS framework of choice. The share amount of code required to implement a state machine using generators more than often outweigh the benefits.

If you are still interested in exploring that path, I recommend looking into the [Actor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model), which originates from Erlang programming language. Although discussing the [Actor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) is beyond the scope of this article, it's one of the better ways to manage state if you do decide to proceed.

> In the Actor model, **actors** are independent entities that encapsulate their own state and behavior. They communicate exclusively only through message passing, ensuring that state is modified only by the actor itself.

## RxJS vs Generators for Processing Web Streams

When it comes to processing streams of data, both JavaScript Generators and [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev) are great tools but each comes with their strength and weaknesses. Lucky for us, they aren't mutually exclusive as we can make use of both.

To showcase this, let's imagine we have an endpoint that returns a multiple randomized 8-character string as a stream. For the first step, We can use a generator function to lazily yield chunks of data as we fetch it from the stream:

```typescript
// Fetch data from HTTP stream
async function* fetchStream() {
  const response = await fetch("https://example/api/stream");
  const reader = response.body?.getReader();
  if (!reader) throw new Error();

  try {
    while (true) {
      const { done, value } = await reader.read();
      if (done) break;
      yield value;
    }
  } catch (error) {
    throw error;
  } finally {
    reader.releaseLock();
  }
}
```

Calling the `fetchStream()` function will return an async generator that we can use to iterate over the chunks of the stream. This is where RxJS comes in handy as it provides a rich set of operators to transform and filter streams of asynchronous data. We'll now use the `take` operator filter the first 5 chunks of data:

```typescript
import { from, take } from "rxjs";

// Consume HTTP stream using RxJS
async () => {
  from(fetchStream())
    .pipe(take(5))
    .subscribe({
      next: (chunk) => {
        const decoder = new TextDecoder();
        console.log("Chunk:", decoder.decode(chunk));
      },
      complete: () => {
        console.log("Stream complete");
      },
    });
};
```

> If you are new to RxJS, the `from` operator converts the async generator into an observable. This allows us to `subscribe` and access the fetched data as if it were synchronous.

Looking at our log output after decoding, we should be able to see the first 5 chunks of the stream:

```txt
Chunk: ky^p1egh
Chunk: 1q)zIz43
Chunk: xm5aJGSX
Chunk: GSx6a2UQ
Chunk: GFlwWPu^
Stream complete
```

We could also use a `for await...of` loop to go through `fetchStream()` and get the same result. But with this approach, we miss out on RxJS operators, which make it easier to manipulate the stream in more flexible ways.

```typescript
// Consume the HTTP stream using for-await-of
for await (const chunk of fetchStream()) {
  const decoder = new TextDecoder();
  console.log("Chunk:", decoder.decode(chunk));
}
```

For example, we can't use the `take` operator to limit the number of chunks we want to consume. However, this limitation won't last forever. When [Iteration Helpers](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-iterator-helpers) land in the next version of ECMAScript (currently at Stage 4 and already merged into the TC39 spec), we’ll have built-in utilities for these use cases—reducing the need for external dependencies.

That said, RxJS remains an incredibly powerful tool for managing complex asynchronous data flows and will likely continue to play an important role in scenarios that demand more advanced stream manipulation.

### Conclusion

Generators are a great feature for creating custom iterators and handling synchronous and asynchronous operations in a straightforward manner. They allow you to pause and resume execution, making them ideal for scenarios where you need fine-grained control over the iteration process.

On the other hand, RxJS is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs. It provides a rich set of operators to transform and filter asynchronous events as collections.
